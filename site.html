<h1> Kinetics </h1>
	<p> Kinetics is the area of chemistry concerning reaction rates. This is difference from spontaneity, the inherent tendency for a reaction to occur, and from
	thermodynamics, concerning the energy of reactions. Many spontaneous reactions occur so slowly that the changes are not detectable. Likewise, reactions that 
	release large amounts of energy are not necessarily slower or faster than those that absorb energy or release only a small amount of energy. For reactions to
	be useful, they must be reasonably fast. Kinetics can help manufacturers speed up reactions.</p>
