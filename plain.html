<h2> 1. What is kinetics? </h2>
<p> Kinetics is the area of chemistry concerning reaction rates. </p>
<p> More on kinetics can be found on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-chemistry/kinetics-ap">Khan Academy</a>. <p> 
<h2> 2. Rate Law </h2>
<p> The differential rate law of a reaction is written in the form Rate=k[A]^n where 
k is the rate constant, [A] is the concentration of the reactant or product A, and n is the order of the reactant A. </p>
<p> The form of the differential rate law of a reaction - the values of k and n - can only be determined experimentally. 
A common way to do this is the method of initial rates, described

<h2> 3. Reaction Mechanism </h2>
<p> A reaction mechanism is the series of elementary steps of a reaction. </p>
<p>For example, the reaction mechanism of a fictional reaction A2 + 2B -> 2AB is <br>
A2 -> A + A <br>
A + B -> AB </p>
<p> <a href="http://butane.chem.uiuc.edu/cyerkes/chem104a_s07/Lecture_Notes_104/Lect10c.html">This page</a> contains a table showing the molecularity and rate law of elementary steps. </p>
<h2> 4. Collision Theory </h2>
<p> For reactants to collide successfully to rearrange to form products:
<ol>
<li> The collision energy must equal or exceed the activation energy. </li>
<li> The relative orientation of the reactants must allow formation of any new bonds necessary to produce products. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> The collision theory was first addressed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_Arrhenius">Svante Arrhenius</a>. He's a cool guy!</p>
