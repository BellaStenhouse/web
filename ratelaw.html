<h1> Rate Law </h1>
    <p> The differential rate law of a reaction is written in the form Rate=k[A]^n where k is the rate constant, [A] is the concentration
        of the reactant or product A, and n is the order of the reactant A. </p>
    <p> The form of the differential rate law of a reaction - the values of k and n - can only be determined experimentally. 
        A common way to do this is the method of initial rates, described
