<h1> Rate Law </h1>
    <p> The rate of a reaction is defined as the change in concentration of a reactant or product per unit time. Rate is always defined
	as a positive quantity, so any rate expression is involving a reactant will include a negative sign, because the concentration of
	a reaction will decrease as the reaction progresses. </p>
    <p> Chemical reactions are reversible, so the change in concentration of a reactant or product depends on the difference in the rates
	of the forward and reverse reactions. This website will focus on conditions where the reverse reaction can be neglected, so that 
	the reaction rate will depend only on the concentration of the reactants. </p>
    <p> The differential rate law of a reaction expresses the rate law as a function of initial concentration of the reactants. 
	It is written in the form Rate=k[A]^n where k is the rate constant, [A] is the concentration of the reactant or product A, and n 
	is the order of the reactant A. </p>
    <p> The form of the differential rate law of a reaction - the values of k and n - can only be determined experimentally. 
        A common way to do this is the method of initial rates, described
