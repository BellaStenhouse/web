<h1> Rate Law </h1>
	<p> The rate of a reaction is defined as the change in concentration of a reactant or product per unit time. Rate is always
	a positive quantity, so any rate expression involving a reactant will include a negative sign, because the concentration of
	a reactant will always decrease as the reaction progresses. </p>
	<p> Chemical reactions are reversible, so the change in concentration of a reactant or product depends on the difference in the rates
	of the forward and reverse reactions. This website will focus on conditions where the reverse reaction can be neglected, so that 
	the reaction rate will depend only on the concentration of the reactants. </p>

<h2> Diffential Rate Law </h2>
	<p> The differential rate law of a reaction expresses the rate as a function of the initial concentration of the reactants. 
	It is written in the form Rate=k[A]<sup>n</sup> where k is the rate constant, [A] is the concentration of the reactant A, and n 
	is the order of the reactant A. </p>
	<p> The form of the differential rate law of a reaction - the values of k and n - can only be determined experimentally. 
        A common way to do this is the method of initial rates, described

<h2> Integrated Rate Law </h2>
	<p> The integrated rate law of a reaction expresses a reactant concentration as a function of time. For first order reactions (differential
	rate law of Rate=k[A]), the integrated rate law is ln[A]=-kt+ln[A]<sub>0</sub>. For second order reactions (differential rate law of Rate=k[A]<sup>2</sup>),
	the integrated rate law is 1/[A]=kt+1/[A]<sub>0</sub>. For zero order reactions (differential rate law of Rate=k), the integrated rate law is [A]=-kt+[A]<sub>0</sub>.
