<h1> Reaction Mechanism </h1>
	<p> A reaction mechanism is the series of elementary steps of a reaction. </p>
	<p>For example, the reaction mechanism of a fictional reaction A<sub>2</sub> + 2B -> 2AB is <br>
		A<sub>2</sub> -> A + A <br>
		A + B -> AB </p>
	<p> Different elementary steps have different rate laws, as shown in the table below. Although the rate law of
		an entire reaction must be determined experimentally, an elementary step's rate law can be determined just
		from its equation. Learn more about elementary steps and molecularity

<h2> Why is knowing the Reaction Mechanism helpful? </h2>
	<p> From the experimentally determined rate law of a reaction, scientists can construct possible mechanisms and test whether they are possible.
	Knowing the steps of a reaction allows us to use the reaction for whatever purpose we need. For example, we could figure out how to increase
	its rate or prevent it from occuring. Determining the reaction mechanism for the production of ammonia has allowed manufacturers
	to speed up the process through the use of iron oxide catalysts, as can be observed below.</p>
